###  Loan Prediction Dataset – Field Details

| Field Name        | Type                 | Meaning                              | Value Range / Units                      | How the Model Considers It |
|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Gender**        | Categorical          | Applicant’s gender                   | "Male" or "Female"                        | Encoded as binary; minor influence based on patterns. |
| **Married**       | Categorical          | Marital status                       | "Yes" or "No"                             | Encoded as binary; married sometimes higher approvals. |
| **Dependents**    | Categorical          | Number of dependents                  | "0", "1", "2", "3+"                        | One-hot encoded; more dependents may lower chance slightly. |
| **Education**     | Categorical          | Education level                       | "Graduate" or "Not Graduate"              | Encoded as binary; graduates slightly higher approvals. |
| **Self_Employed** | Categorical          | Self-employment status                | "Yes" or "No"                              | Encoded as binary; self-employed may have small negative weight. |
| **ApplicantIncome** | Numeric             | Applicant’s monthly income (₹)        | Positive integers                          | Higher income increases approval chance. |
| **CoapplicantIncome** | Numeric           | Co-applicant’s monthly income (₹)     | Positive integers or 0                     | Adds to repayment capacity. |
| **LoanAmount**    | Numeric              | Loan amount requested (₹, thousands)  | Example: 100 = ₹100,000                    | Higher amount vs income may lower chance. |
| **Loan_Amount_Term** | Numeric           | Loan term in days                     | e.g., 360, 120, 84                         | Longer terms can slightly increase probability. |
| **Credit_History** | Numeric (binary)    | Past loan repayment record            | 1.0 = good history, 0.0 = bad/no history   | Most important feature for approval. |
| **Property_Area** | Categorical          | Location type of property             | "Urban", "Semiurban", "Rural"              | One-hot encoded; semiurban often has higher odds. |
| **Loan_Status**   | Target Variable      | Approval status                       | "Y" (1) or "N" (0)                         | What the model predicts. |
